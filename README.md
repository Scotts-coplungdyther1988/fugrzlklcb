Just walked out of the theater after 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨 Until Dawn, and honestly, my brain feels like an untuned radio. You know when you’re exhausted but so wired you just keep rambling to yourself? That’s me right now. I’m not even sure if I liked it, but it definitely left me...someone? somewhere? I don't even know.

Let’s start with the obvious: the visuals. If I had a dollar for every time I thought, Hey, shouldn't this be a video game? I'd probably be able to 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the   legally instead of trying to find some sketchy copy 𝘰𝘯𝘭𝘪𝘯𝘦. But seriously, the whole thing felt like a frantic fever dream. It’s those stark contrasts, like shadow puppets dancing bops to a Jaws-inspired soundtrack. Anyone else get that Spielberg knock-off vibe from the jump scares?

Then there are the characters. Oh man, have you ever tried explaining your aunt's awkward holiday argument to a stranger? That's basically how every single interaction felt. Like you’re frustrated, but also sort of amused because it’s just so off? Some scenes are downright Shakespearean in their drama, but others have the emotional depth of a soggy cereal box. I’m still trying to decide if that's genius or just plain bad writing.

> Enter sarcasm: Such a groundbreaking plot, I mumble under my breath, rolling my eyes harder than the scriptwriter's ham-fisted dialogue decisions. Teenage angst in the midst of literally running for their lives? Sure, why not. I’m convinced they might've had a contest for the least plausible lines and the writers all tied.

Random tangent: Am I supposed to admire the score because seriously, the whole thing sounds like someone's stressed-out parrot mixed orchestras on a VCR. It’s not bad, just...bizarre, like an art student's dumpster dive into the world of 𝘧𝘪𝘭𝘮 sound.

Here's a real head-scratcher for ya, midway through, I started contemplating existential dread. Not even sure why. Maybe it's the impending doom mixed with tension that just makes you wanna check the time and simultaneously scream existential nonsense at the top of your lungs. Okay, enough of my anxiety unraveling on the internet.

    while not safe:

And just to top it all off, by the end, I was both relieved and oddly disappointed that they actually wrapped it up. Like ending a chaotic car ride; you’re glad it’s over, but was that really the best route? Yeah, that sums it up. So, in the void of sanity, do I think it's worth 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨? Sure, grab some popcorn and let your inner critic run wild. Just don’t say I didn’t warn you!
